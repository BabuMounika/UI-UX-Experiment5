# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
Start

Load the homepage layout

Import the structure containing navigation bar, banner, product grid, and footer.

Identify the UI elements to alter

e.g., Banner images, Featured Product Lists, Category Sections.

Capture user preferences or input

Based on browsing history, clicks, or manual user settings.

Apply alteration rules

If user prefers electronics → move “Electronics” category to top.

If time of day = evening → show “Deals of the Day” banner.

Re-render the updated layout dynamically

Use JavaScript or React to update components without full page reload.

Save the modified interface settings

Store preferences in local storage or a user profile database.

Display the altered interface

End
